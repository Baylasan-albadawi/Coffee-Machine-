# Coffee-Machine
This project is about making the best cup of coffee in town! It employs Object Oriented Design Concepts. The following guidelines help you Know the system’s main objects and their relationships:

Great Coffee starts with great beans, there are two main types of beans, Arabica, Robusta, or a blend.
The machine is filled with water and beans, the user then selects the type of Coffee he wants, that can be:
1.	Espresso, which can be:
a.	Single
b.	double
2.	Americano, which can be:
a.	Single
b.	Double

Espresso single shot uses 7g of ground coffee and 30 ml of water, while double uses 14g of ground coffee and 60 ml of water. Americano use 7g of ground coffee and 170ml of water for single and 14g of ground coffee and 220ml for double.

After selecting the Coffee choice, the user can hit the start button and Coffee grinder will start grinding the beans, then the brewer, using hot water and pressure, will brew the Coffee and then pour it in the cup.
The size of the grind is important to the taste of the Coffee, so, the Coffee grinder is adjustable to give you the best taste.
The Coffee machine can tell you a few useful information; the total amount of Caffeine the Coffee contains and calories. The Coffee machine has a water and beans capacity, so it will stop when it’s out of any. It also needs cleaning, after serving a specific number of cups, an indicator is displayed asking for emptying the drip tray and waste.
